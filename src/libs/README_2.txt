The directory, 'Extension-Biomass-Harvest ...\src\libs' is where required .dlls are stored for building 
the Biomass Harvest extension.  Initially, the directory, 'Extension-Biomass-Harvest...\src\libs' 
will contain ONLY these two files:

README_2.pdf
README_2.txt

Building the solution (.sln) file in Visual Studio will populate this folder with a set of required .dlls.
